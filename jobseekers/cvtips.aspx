    <h1>CV and Interview Tips</h1>
    <h3>Your CV</h3>
    <p>The CV is the first impression an employer will get from you and first impressions get you the job.<p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Your CV must be easy to read, concise, giving factual information on your history of experience and qualifications in reverse chronological order.</li>
        <li>Keep it to 2 pages.  A prospective employer will not read a long CV.  Besides you need to keep something to discuss at the Interview.</li>
        <li>Include contact details of 3 Referees (only include those that will give a positive reference.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Interview</h3>
    <p>This is your time to shine! Being well prepared is the key to success. First impressions are made within 30 seconds; you need show yourself in the best possible manner.<p>
    <h3>Be Prepared</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Prior to interview, research the Company to which you are applying thoroughly, so you completely understand them and their market.</li>
        <li>The interview is an opportunity for both the employer and you to decide if you are the right fit for the job opportunity. Interviewers have limited information about you on which to base their final decision, so how you look, how you behave, your attitude and your delivery of your knowledge will influence your success rate and will help them make their final decision in your favor.</li>
        <li>Arrive 15 minutes early to allow you time to relax and familiarise yourself with the environment. Announce yourself to Reception, giving your name, who you are being interviewed by and your appointment time. You may be asked to complete an application form, so complete it in clear handwriting, correctly and in full, checking it before handing it back.</li>
        <li>Greet your interviewer with a smile and a firm handshake.  Use his/her surname only unless otherwise instructed.  Sit well back in the chair which will create a more relaxed atmosphere.  Make eye contact with the interviewer, smile, nod to express agreement and enthusiasm and use the tone of your voice in a positive manner.</li>
    </ul>
